# EXCLUSIONS AND THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS
The DEAP dataset subset and any other third-party content included in this repository are not licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 and are provided subject to their own terms. Such materials remain the property of their respective rights holders. 

This repository includes a minimal subset of the DEAP dataset to enable research, testing, and illustration of the AIM4KD framework:
- Participant: 1 of 32
- Channels: 4 of 40 (Ch37 GSR, Ch38 RESP, Ch39 BVP, Ch40 TEMP)

Redistribution basis: According to the DEAP EULA, redistribution of dataset materials is not permitted. This repository includes a limited subset for non‑substitutive research and reproducibility. Where redistribution permissions are limited or interpreted differently in your jurisdiction, this excerpt is also provided under a good‑faith belief that it qualifies as fair use (or an analogous research/quotation exception), considering:
- The purpose is non‑substitutive research, testing, and academic demonstration;
- The excerpt is quantitatively and qualitatively limited relative to the full dataset;
- The use enables reproducibility and evaluation of the framework without undermining the market for the full DEAP dataset.

Important:
- This DEAP subset is third‑party material and is NOT covered by the repository’s CC BY‑SA 4.0 license.
- All rights remain with the original DEAP rights holders.
- Users who need the complete dataset must obtain access directly from the DEAP providers in accordance with their EULA.

Please contact the DEAP team for access to the dataset.
