## ðŸ“„ Abstract

This paper introduces our Agnostic Interpretable Machine Learning for Knowledge Discovery (AIM4KD) framework, which advances emotionalâ€‘stress detection by integrating dataset preprocessing, classification, knowledgeâ€‘discovery techniques, and visualisation methods to augment traditional machineâ€‘learning pipelines.

The core innovation lies in an agnostic strategy that processes multiple dataset variants and applies several classification algorithms with dynamic configuration settings. This approach yields highâ€‘quality logic rules, ensuring that the most significant patterns emerge for effective knowledge discovery.

We validated AIM4KD with extensive experiments on the DEAP dataset, a key resource in affective computing for examining physiological changes during emotional episodes. When benchmarked against conventional preprocessing and classification methods using treeâ€‘based and forest algorithms, AIM4KD produced an average 22â€‘fold increase in highâ€‘quality rules.

These results demonstrate the frameworkâ€™s efficacy in accurately detecting emotionalâ€‘stress states, its capacity to handle complex multimodal datasets, and the importance of interpretability in machine learning. The findings highlight AIM4KDâ€™s potential to improve decisionâ€‘making processes in physiological data analysis and its applicability across domains involving intricate timeâ€‘series dataâ€”such as health or financeâ€”by helping experts uncover underlying dynamics.

To foster broader adoption and support future research, we will release the AIM4KD framework code and the DEAPâ€‘dataset preprocessing script publicly at https://github.com/CyberNautâ€‘AU/AIM4KD upon final acceptance of the paper.
